# Citi Bike New York City
## Overview
In this analysis, our goal is to show investors in Des Moines, Iowa that it will be profitable to have a bike-sharing service in the city. We will do this by taking bike-sharing data for CitiBikes in New York City.

## Results

We created 7 different visualizations to show investors that they should invest in the bike-sharing service in Des Moines. The are located in this [Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/annie1614#!/vizhome/Challenge_16030385401720/Challenge).

1. Checkout Times for Users
![Checkout Times](https://github.com/AnnieShaffer/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Checkout_Times_For_Users.png)
- This graph tells us that the length of time for CitiBike ridesharers to use a bike is highest between 5 and 7 am each day. This makes sense because many people in New Yourk City, and Manhattan specifically, would be on their morning commute during this time. If they are travelling longer distances, they will need to leave earlier in the morning to make it to work on time.

2. Checkout Times by Gender
![Checkout by Gender](https://github.com/AnnieShaffer/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Checkout_Times_by_Gender.png)
- In this graph, we can see that men are more likely to take longer trips on the CitiBike than women or those who do not list a gender.

3. Trips During the Week
![Trip Heatmap](https://github.com/AnnieShaffer/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Trips_by_Weekday.png)
- We created a heatmap to show the peak hours during the week that the CitiBike bike-sharing service is used. Based on the data, we can conclude that the CitiBikes are used most Monday-Friday from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM and 4:00 PN to 7:00 PM when people are traveling to and from work. On the weekends, the bikes are used pretty regularly from 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM with Saturday as the more popular day.

4. Trips Throughout the Week Measured by Gender
![Trip Heatmap by Gender](https://github.com/AnnieShaffer/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Trips_by_Gender_Weekday_Hour.png)
- Similar to the checkout times based on gender, we see in the heatmap of trip times during the week, that men are much more likely to use the CitiBike bike-sharing service. The heatmaps each follow a very similar pattern as the previous heatmap.

5. Customers and Subscribers by Gender
![Users by Gender](https://github.com/AnnieShaffer/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/User_Trips_by_Gender.png)
- The graph shows that men are mostly likely to subscribe to the CitiBike bike-sharing service. Additionally, they are not as likely to be one time customers. This is similar for women, however the total number of women using the service is lower. An interesting observation that can be made from this chart is that those who do not list a gender are more likely to just be customers and not subscribers of the service.

6. Popular Starting Locations
![Starting Locations](https://github.com/AnnieShaffer/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Top_Starting_Locations.png)
- In this map, we can see that the most popular starting stations are located in lower to mid-Manhattan. Additionally, the northern portions of Manhattan and Brooklyn do not have many popular stations. Some reasons for this could include that upper Manahatten tends to have more affluent families and they may not be the target market for this service. Additionally, those in the outer boroughs of New York City have the option to take the Subway to the lower Manhattan bike-sharing stations so avoid riding bikes across any bridges.

7. Poplar Return Locations
![Ending Locations](https://github.com/AnnieShaffer/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Top_Ending_Locations.png)
- This map shows very similar information to the starting locations. This is positive because it shows that the bikes are returning to the locations that they are needed at each day. This ensures that each station will have availability for the next day. From the starting and ending location maps, it can also be determined which areas need to begin with a certain number of bikes, and the number of bikes that should be maintained at each location to make the bike-sharing model profitable.

## Summary
In summary, the New York City CitiBike bike-sharing data shows that the users most likely to utilize the Citibike service are males when commuting to and from work during the week. Males are also the users most likely to have a subscription to the bike-sharing service.

Additional visualization could include:
- The age of the average user of the BikeSharing service. This data could give insight into whether or not those in Des Moines are in the age group most likely to use the service.
- The average number of miles used by each bike per day will also show if the bike service would work in Des Moines. New York City will have buildings and areas much closer together than Des Moines. If people are more likely to use the bike for longer distances in New Yor City, they are more likely to use the service in Des Moines.
